# Iris Flower Species Prediction Using Random Forest

This repository contains a practice exercise for predicting the species of Iris flowers using a Random Forest classifier. The classification is based on the width and height of the sepal and petal measurements.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset from the `sklearn` library. The Iris dataset is a popular dataset in machine learning and contains measurements of 150 iris flowers from three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample in the dataset includes the sepal and petal width and length.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/w412k/iris-flower-prediction.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies. Make sure you have Python and the necessary packages installed (e.g., scikit-learn).

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing the code for the random forest classifier.

4. Run the code to train the classifier on the Iris dataset and make predictions.

## Confusion Matrix

The performance of the classifier is evaluated using a confusion matrix. The confusion matrix allows us to visualize the accuracy of the model's predictions for each class (species of Iris flower).

## Results

Include any important findings or results from your analysis here. You can discuss the accuracy of the classifier, any insights gained, or potential areas for improvement.
